# Macrocounter

IIFYM

Basic calculator for keeping track of one's daily macronutrients.

To use:

  * Set a total macronutrient goal (how many of each macro you want to eat daily)
  * Enter foods you eat
  * MacroCounter will subtract those macros from your goal

To start your Phoenix app:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`
